Plants 🌱, coffee ☕, matcha 🍵, and fashion enthusiast ✨

I am a multi-faceted person -- but most importantly, I am a versatile Full Stack Engineer with an eye for design and highly-functional, intuitive user experiences. I am passionate at making enticing and seamless applications that are both enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing -- using ReactJS/Redux.

Coming from a Fashion Merchandising and Design background, critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity are consistently my most valued skills that are easily transferrable to software engineering and just about anything I set my mind to. I am always motivated to learn new skills and helping others succeed as well as making the world a better place!
